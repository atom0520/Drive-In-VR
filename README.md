# Drive-in-VR
This is a game I made for an assignment of my University VR course, which is a VR game that lets you tour around a lovely park in a car. The game was made with Unity 2017.1.1f1.

### Operation On PC
Hold down the LEFT ALT key and move the mouse pointer horizontally to rotate the camera around Y axis.<br/>
Hold down the LEFT ALT key and move the mouse pointer vertically to rotate the camera around X axis.<br/>
Hold down the LEFT CONTROL key and move the mouse pointer horizontally to rotate the camera around Z axis.<br/>

### Note
After downloading the project files, remember to Unzip the "Plugins.zip" file in the "Assets" folder before opening the project in Unity.
